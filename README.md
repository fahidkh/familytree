# Family Trees

This project was defensed on August 2022.
As a part of my bachelor degree in Computer Science
German Jordanian University

## Undertaking

This is to declare that the project entitled “Family Tree” is an original work done
by undersigned, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree “Bachelor in
Computer Science” at Computer Science Department, School of Electrical Engineering
and Information Technology, German Jordanian University.
All the analysis, design and system development have been accomplished by the
undersigned. Moreover, this project has not been submitted to any other college or
university.

## ABSTRACT

The explosion of social media is changing the way we communicate, thus affecting
the processes involved with connecting to each other, I found that there is a need for a new
way to keep families connected to strengthen the bond between old and new generation, the
purpose of this project is to create a “Family Tree” that all members of the family can
connect to each other and helping them to have a better and more private way.
In this project, each family member will have the chance to locate and know his far relatives
and connect with them under the umbrella of this application

## Introduction

Social media started as a concept where you can check up on your family and friends.
But now days with all the advertisements and pages on these popular social media
platforms this concept is beginning to fade. Family Tree aims to make it easier for you
to communicate and keep in touch with your relatives.

## Overview

As a main purpose Family Tree brings your relatives closer by a feed where you
can post, a shared calendar, and a visualized dynamic family tree.

## Project Motivation

The reason behind my choice to develop this project because of the social
distancing that occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic which raised the
need for other way of communication within the family members. I think
that the project is important because it adds an easy to navigate and
modern way to communicate with family members.


## Problem Statement


Looking at other social media websites I found out it that they neglect the medium
and far family relationship connections, and they don’t give a wide and clear vision
on the different family connections between the same family members


## Project Aim and Objectives
This project aims to bring family relations closer by implementing features of
communication

## Project Scope
Family Tree is created for people who enjoy a private closer social media platform
for their families that includes all necessary algorithms and data to provide users
with the right communication purposes. This includes complex data regarding
Families, connections, posts, and user types.

## Project Software and Hardware Requirements
to use the website, you would need an internet browser and internet connection and
a google account for authorization

## Project Limitations
full mobile device support is not available.

## Project Expected Output
A fully fledged and scalable social media website.

## Project Schedule
April 2022 – Idea of the project came to be
May 2022 – Diagrams and Schemas finalization
June 2022 – Persevering on the methodologies of the code
July 2022 – Development, testing and debugging
August 2022 – Deployment of the website


## Project, product, and schedule risks
Project risk: Not all family members join the tree which would leave empty spots in the
family tree
Product risk: people accessing the website from their mobile application
Schedule risk: implementation of the visual family tree could take a lot of time

## Related Works
### Introduction
In this project the focus was not to create a normal social media
website. The vision is to have a private family only platform where
communication is easy and secure between the members of the family
### Existing Systems
there are many existing systems; Most famous ones are: Facebook,
Instagram
### Overall Problems of Existing Systems
they neglect the medium and far family relationship connections, and
they don’t give a wide and clear vision on the different family
connections between the same family members
### Overall Solution Approaches
With Family Tree’s many features family connections are closer and
clearer than ever

## Methodology
### Overview
when creating this project, I tried to implement more of a modern approach of
programming and methodologies; While trying to avoid risks and keep the
project within reach.

### Description of Implementation
Implementing Family Tree was a challenge but with planning it became a reality.
Using Firebase with React helped with the backend side of things. Firestore is a
Cloud based database its free and ready to use service from Google. Then I
deployed React elements. React elements are plain objects representing the
component type (e.g. App ) and the props. User-defined components (e.g. App )
can be classes or functions but they all “render to” elements. “Mounting” is a
recursive process that creates a DOM or Native tree given the top-level React
element (e.g. <App /> ).

### Programming language and technology
To build the Website I used Javascript ReactJS, HTML, CSS, MUI, Firebase, Firestore
Databases. React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for
building user interfaces or UI components. It lets you compose complex UIs
from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. It is used by
large established companies and startups alike (Netflix, Airbnb
Instagram, and the New York Times, to name a few). React brings many advantages to
the table, making it a better choice than other frameworks like Angular.js.

## Conclusion and Future Works
In Conclusion, Family Tree as a social platform connects members of families in a
new way, powered by modern JavaScript libraries such as ReactJS which provides ease of
use and fast responding on any browser.
For the future of Family Tree, I plan to add more work into the website, more
optimizations such as more Security measures and more features; Scale the website as it
gets bigger and get more users.
